# Analyzing depth equation 

The radius of the Circle of Confusion (CoC) depends on other parameters according to the following equation: \


$$|S_2-S_1|f^2 \over S_1N(S_1-f) $$

where $S_1$ is the focal distance, $S_2$ is the distance to the object point, $f$ is the focal length \
and $N$ is the f-number of the lense. \



 
When $a \ne 0$, there are two solutions to $(ax^2 + bx + c = 0)$ and they are 
$$ x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a} $$

**The Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality**

$$\left( \sum_{k=1}^n a_k b_k \right)^2 \leq \left( \sum_{k=1}^n a_k^2 \right) \left( \sum_{k=1}^n b_k^2 \right)$$

**Here is some math!**
