# Analyzing depth equation 

The radius of the Circle of Confusion (CoC) depends on other parameters according to the following equation:


$$|S_2-S_1|f^2 \over S_1N(S_1-f) $$

where $S_1$ is the focal distance, $S_2$ is the distance to the object point, $f$ is the focal length \
and $N$ is the f-number of the lense.

The variation of $CoC$ vs $S_1$ for different values of $S_2$ can be plot as the figure bellow \
