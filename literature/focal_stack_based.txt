******deep depth from focus with differential focal volume by Yang et.al(CVPR2022)*******

focal stack : to obtain a well focused image, digital cameras take many photos at a time with varying focal lengths. 
		the stack of these images are called focal stack. 
image context can be another cue to estimate depth. But we sould need to build scene-specific models


other technique : Depth From Defocus (DFD) - try to build a mathematical model between the depth and defocus pattern
		 assume a point in centralized in a small planner region and the point spread fuction (PSF) assumes a 
		certain destribution. But these assumptions oftern fail in the real world
technique from this paper : Depth From Focus (DFF)
			Assumes that one and only one frame conains a best focused image of a certain pixel and 
			the respective focal lenght of this frame is the depth of this pixel.

challenges :
how to measure the quality of focus ?
how to deal with textureless surfaces ? (focal measures does not work well when the surfaces are textureless)
in these cases we might want to resprt to contexual details
high sampling frequency requirement :
	if the imaged point falls within the depth of field of the camera, there should be one sharp pixel in the 
	focal stack. But if the sampling rate of the camera is too low we might not get this image in the 
	focal stack. 

main idea:
	use CNN to learn a deep focus measure
	the features learned by the CNN can also represent contexual information.
	So this method uses both focal measure and context information for performing DFF


why is this method related to stereo matching?
Depth of field (DoF) ?
Cicle of Confusion (CoC)?


******notes/ideas*******
source of error of the keypoint based p4p problem that I tried:
*if focal length is not equal to the distance to the hand, the keypoints will be blured and 
the location will be erroneous
